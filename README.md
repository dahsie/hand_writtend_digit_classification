# hand_writtend_digit_classification
The purpose of this projet is to build a deep learning model from scratch in order to classify hand writtend digits.
First, I build a Multi-Layers Perceptrons (MLPs) model which allow to get an accuracy of 98%.
Second, I try another architecture. I build my own Convnet model from scratch which allow me to get 99% of accuracy
